Re Negotiation: Know exactly what you want & focus on that. View conflict as an opportunity--this will expand your mind and your horizons.
Believe you can and you're halfway there.

All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

@TierraUniversu It was fixed this weekend, so he should try the test again.

German govt reviews Tesla Model S fires. All due to high speed impacts, no injuries. Concludes: no defects, no recall http://t.co/24iZzOSL3B
All known rocket anomalies resolved. Will spend another day rechecking to be sure. Launch attempt tmrw eve w Wed as backup.
The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower & weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably <50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...
Launch aborted by autosequence due to slower than expected thrust ramp. Seems ok on closer inspection. Cycling countdown.

Publishers and authors all fighting Amazon
Amazon fighting book publishers for higher margins.  Result might be cheaper books, but end of all remaining book shops. Monopoly for Amazon
Only way for shared growth and re-employment of millions is massive, even risky, deregulation, allow small businesses to start up and grow.
World's central bankers meet, most with failed policies printing money, causing big inflation in asset values, very few jobs.
Friend of privacy?  New planned Google mapping satellites will carry high definition cameras capable of facial recognition!
Recapture of Mosul Dam was great cooperative effort, but further actions await Obama's decision. Tough one but no real choice.
ISIS can only be beaten by policy of elimination and even then with difficulty.  This is historic war of barbarism v, civilization.
Looking forward to reading Paul Ryan's The Way Forward.  Ryan the most influential Republican in Congress.  Will report.
Why are CA jails  filled with largely young guilty of minor crimes? Jerry Brown, please. Vast expense, social damage. Overpaid staff too.
Will Congress act on demilitarisation of police when it reconvenes?
NSA privacy invasion bad, but nothing compared to Google.
Barbaric ISIS has few hundred US Brit & Oz  recruits, all planning to return. Secret services' no idea of identities. Huge dangers ahead.
US has historic high in people out of work.  Major changes needed to open opportunities, fix schools,or face more Fergusons.
@Rand Paul "demilitarise the police".    Mighty interesting but is it practical?    Maybe test in one big city first, but principle right.
In SF just looking many start ups, mixed successes ahead, but Stripe, by brilliant Collison brothers outstanding.

#Europe finished for ten years or forever? Hope not, but they share key enemy to South with Russia.  Theory sounds glib, but not impossible.

Happy Thanksgiving all.  Busy teaching young generation it's full meaning.
Pity no action this year on immigration. Obama working with Republicans gives hope for real action early 2014, otherwise take years.
Thanks for all for attending WSJ CEO conference, especially President.
WSJ  CEO conference great success. Plenty of worries. Obama, Christie, Ryan very impressive, but Summers knockout with sheer brilliance.
Pope Francis revitalising Church worldwide with wonderful challenging statements and actions. Certainly making me, like others, rethink much
Looks like QE keeps going for long time, just making rich richer leaving masses behind, also serious global dislocations.
Reading Francis Collins in  WSJ on genetics, can we all live to 120 or more?  Probably not, but our children for sure.
Inspiring evening in North Carolina for Billy Graham's 95 th birthday. 
800 dedicated evangelicals.  Good people doing good works.
Tech driving world change ever faster.  Bill Gates, with his wonderful philanthropy argues otherwise, but using new tech in all great works.
Newscorp sad case of damage by ignorant consultants.   Fast being repaired by infusion of experienced managers.
Australia feels totally different to six months ago.  Govt will cut massive  regulations giving real optimism. Should cancel wild spending.
Townsville Bulletin excellent local paper.  All North Australia will experience booming growth with new state and federal governments.
Great to be with Frank Lowy tonight for the @LowyInstitute anniversary dinner. Honored to be a part of this event. http://t.co/XYblWDukuD

Big media trials in London in 2 weeks.   Remember, everyone innocent until proven guilty, entitled to fair trial in most countries.
If universal reports true, O should quickly rename Obamacare as Pelosicare.   Smart Republicans lying low, waiting for next year.
POTUS has spoken of entitlement reform and competitive corporate taxes Why wait?  Political point scoring ineffective after crisis past.
SV/SF, Israel, Beijing will remain greatest centers of innovation so long as they keep attracting most clever young techies. Change unlikely
Of course innovation is everywhere, but not great transformational work until governments get out of way.  Eg. EPA closing down nanotech.
@Mr.G.  BBC has couple hundred right wingers!   2/12 per cent.      Name them. BBC has won, what hope for UK to join 21st century? Wake up.
San Francisco - Silicon Valley spirit gives one new hope for US. World has three great innovation centres: SF, Israel, Beijing. That order.
Back in amazing Silicon Valley. Wonderful Stanford University inspires.
No deficit cuts pre fiscal cliff and both sides lose See polls. Obama ought to be happy with 80 per cent win. " I won" argument unpopular.
My very best wishes to Michael Rooney, leaving Dow Jones/WSJ for sabbatical. A great, talented ad man. And tall! http://t.co/z4e0J89okt
BBC massive taxpayer funded mouthpiece for tiny circulation leftist Guardian.  Meanwhile print media about to be gagged to protect toffs.
Huge lack of balance in UK media with 8000 BBC left wing journalists far outnumbering all national print journalists.
Let's hope POTUS has real negotiations before fiscal cliff, as all other presidents have done.   Otherwise he will be blamed for big crash.
US energy self-sufficiency and  big bi-partisan deal would lead to years of boom, job growth.  Must come next few days or we face disaster.
Govt shutdown and debt limit make for huge, dangerous crisis. Deal with plenty for both sides possible opening route to millions of jobs.
Republicans, muscle shown, now link debt  to big deal: allow Obamacare for now, get entitlements change, biz tax cut, go for growth All win
Simplicity so much easier, and both more beautiful and stronger.  Leads closer to fairness for all.
Cruz' grandstanding will cost him long-term, smarter Rand Paul silent. Meanwhile# both sides seem incapable of political deal making.
Are Republicans self-destructing just when Obama at his weakest? Partial govt shut-down small issue compared to possible default.
.@GabbyStern1 enjoy, now turn out a great wsj tomorrow!
Interesting visit from Afghan foreign minister.  Credits most progress to completely free media since2001. Election conduct next year vital.
@joey b.  am I turning libertarian?   In some respects always have been.
German,, UK. US polls all show 18-24year olds turning libertarian. Want less govt at all levels, more opportunities now.Historic moment.
Week ends with confusion about Fed policy, but growing realization most of economy, and mass of families, in bad shape, not improving.
@robert elliott.  Pope taking Church down path of Anglicans.  Wrong! Many Anglicans divided and some  really giving up all faith.
Pope Francis setting great example in humility and thought provoking  open thinking.   Really refreshing.
Great first day by PM Abbott firing top bureaucrats,merging departments and killing carbon tax.  Much more to do yet.
WH courageous in refusing greedy demands for Obamacare exemptions for big unions.   Encouraging.
Game, set and match to Putin with unknown consequences. Maybe right to arm secular rebels six months ago, now too late.
Al Gore.  Pls explain record increase in Arctic ice. Other greenies crippling US growth in opposing safe tracking for natural gas.
Unprecedented hard times for US youth generation, but nothing compared to Europe.  Euro currency discipline making for bigger social crisis.
US recovery hard to find across country.  Real wages since 2007 for under 35s down, over 35s up average less than one per cent. Really tough
Reading all the tributes to Hillary Clinton as amazingly hard working Secretary of State. But what legacy did she leave?
Congratulations to the entire @nypost team on their website relaunch.  More great things to come! http://t.co/IUFerBmgG1
As long predicted, QE2 would not create jobs, only make rich richer.Now, how to back off without further damage?
Small item:   Apart from higher pay, public workers in Australia take many more sick days than those in hard working private sector!
@nikt50 where is my evidence?   Listen to talk back radio in UK and US, see masses of letters to editors and you will be convinced.
@registradus biggest problem multinationals not paying taxes? Not biggest, but real problem. Amazon,Google, etc should pay like rest of us.
@rupertmurdoch "Tele wot won it"!   No, Australians just sick of Gillard'-Rudd incompetence and infighting wrecking great county.
@gabriellecj "Tele wot won it"!  No. Australians just sick of GilardRudd
@joelcamb believe in Paid Parental Leave?  Yes, completely, but should and could be paid for by business, not taxpayers.
Aust election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy.Others nations to follow in time
House and Senate members receiving record number of constituency calls overwhelmingly opposed to Syrian intervention.
Price of sudden US isolationism will be huge power vacuum waiting to be filled by very willing bad guys.
@BritRoyalsEire Stealth bombers too expensive?  Really?  Paid off well for Bill Clinton in Balkans.
Nobody wants invasion of Syria by US, but what will a few Tomahawks achieve?  Where are our Stealth bombers if we need them?
What is worse n Syria?  Monster Assad backed by Iran and Russia or Al Qeada and Brotherhood with even bigger ambitions?  Shame O boxed in.
Obama in huge gamble risking lame duckery. Clinton never asked before throwing missiles around. Polls will be terrible unless Assad repeats.
Fracking will make US not only energy independent but cheapest country for industry, homes, etc with massive boost for employment Wake up NY
@antonbar Google way ahead with metadata.  Yes, but not without some  interesting players competing with great leaders. Msoft cash may tempt
Microsoft change fascinating.  Big hedge funds at least partly responsible. Successor needs to get back in front of tech world. Metadata?
Obama attack on spiralling tertiary education costs right, but should focus on failing K-12 scandal, hurting especially minority kids.
Conviction politicians hard to find anywhere.  Australia's  Tony Abbott rare exception. Opponent Rudd all  over the place convincing nobody.
Good for UK Chief Rabbi Sacks!  "Let's put multiculturalism  behind us". Societies have to integrate.  Muslims find it hardest.

Cutting regs needed to create opportunities for jobless graduates and middle class to start small businesses and get real growth.
Political class horrible.  Just look at NY Sate and city prospects. Pols gutless, incompetent and too many corrupt. While jobless increase.
US job crisis very serious.  Stimulus v. Deficit debate irrelevant. All levels of govt must cut regulations, company tax ( and deductions)
Oz politics!  We all like ideal of NBN, especially perfect for Foxtel. But first how can it be financed in present situation?
Over regulation, both fed, state and county, and uncertainty stopping small business start ups essential for recovery and employment.
Friday job figures terrible. Lowest percentage in work for 30 years.20pc workers on part time. Average wages going down, food etc prices up.
Consider K-12 system.  Every kid should graduate well, vs today's 30pc drop out. Let's try vouchers, like New Orleans. Great results
@mathof1 @JohnRentoul "great fortunes don't survive long".  Not talking about the Brit class system.
@NCMarrk opportunities exist, just being killed by regulations.  Right, and uncertainty.
@MatthewLumby billionaires paying almost no taxes.  How about starting killing ALL deductions and flat tax on all after first 50k?
Making rich poorer won't do much.  Giving opportunity to poor to become rich is the only way forward. Great fortunes don't survive long.
@russ_clayton am I off Capri.  No!  Working in NY.
Disparity of wealth much worse with Fed printing trillions, most of it ending up in Wall Street automatically making rich richer.
POTUS right about greater and greater disparity of wealth. Even worse societal effects than he realises. BUT curable with good education.
Job situation remains terrible.  Wide small business startups needed. Make possible by slashing regulations, fed, state and county. Only way
Publishers and authors all fighting Amazon
Amazon fighting book publishers for higher margins.  Result might be cheaper books, but end of all remaining book shops. Monopoly for Amazon
Only way for shared growth and re-employment of millions is massive, even risky, deregulation, allow small businesses to start up and grow.
World's central bankers meet, most with failed policies printing money, causing big inflation in asset values, very few jobs.
Friend of privacy?  New planned Google mapping satellites will carry high definition cameras capable of facial recognition!
Recapture of Mosul Dam was great cooperative effort, but further actions await Obama's decision. Tough one but no real choice.
ISIS can only be beaten by policy of elimination and even then with difficulty.  This is historic war of barbarism v, civilization.
Looking forward to reading Paul Ryan's The Way Forward.  Ryan the most influential Republican in Congress.  Will report.
Why are CA jails  filled with largely young guilty of minor crimes? Jerry Brown, please. Vast expense, social damage. Overpaid staff too.
Will Congress act on demilitarisation of police when it reconvenes?
NSA privacy invasion bad, but nothing compared to Google.
Barbaric ISIS has few hundred US Brit & Oz  recruits, all planning to return. Secret services' no idea of identities. Huge dangers ahead.
US has historic high in people out of work.  Major changes needed to open opportunities, fix schools,or face more Fergusons.
@Rand Paul "demilitarise the police".    Mighty interesting but is it practical?    Maybe test in one big city first, but principle right.
In SF just looking many start ups, mixed successes ahead, but Stripe, by brilliant Collison brothers outstanding.

Cutting regs needed to create opportunities for jobless graduates and middle class to start small businesses and get real growth.
Political class horrible.  Just look at NY Sate and city prospects. Pols gutless, incompetent and too many corrupt. While jobless increase.
US job crisis very serious.  Stimulus v. Deficit debate irrelevant. All levels of govt must cut regulations, company tax ( and deductions)
Oz politics!  We all like ideal of NBN, especially perfect for Foxtel. But first how can it be financed in present situation?
Over regulation, both fed, state and county, and uncertainty stopping small business start ups essential for recovery and employment.
Friday job figures terrible. Lowest percentage in work for 30 years.20pc workers on part time. Average wages going down, food etc prices up.
Consider K-12 system.  Every kid should graduate well, vs today's 30pc drop out. Let's try vouchers, like New Orleans. Great results
@mathof1 @JohnRentoul "great fortunes don't survive long".  Not talking about the Brit class system.
@NCMarrk opportunities exist, just being killed by regulations.  Right, and uncertainty.
@MatthewLumby billionaires paying almost no taxes.  How about starting killing ALL deductions and flat tax on all after first 50k?
Making rich poorer won't do much.  Giving opportunity to poor to become rich is the only way forward. Great fortunes don't survive long.
@russ_clayton am I off Capri.  No!  Working in NY.
Disparity of wealth much worse with Fed printing trillions, most of it ending up in Wall Street automatically making rich richer.
POTUS right about greater and greater disparity of wealth. Even worse societal effects than he realises. BUT curable with good education.
Job situation remains terrible.  Wide small business startups needed. Make possible by slashing regulations, fed, state and county. Only way
Publishers and authors all fighting Amazon
Amazon fighting book publishers for higher margins.  Result might be cheaper books, but end of all remaining book shops. Monopoly for Amazon
Only way for shared growth and re-employment of millions is massive, even risky, deregulation, allow small businesses to start up and grow.
World's central bankers meet, most with failed policies printing money, causing big inflation in asset values, very few jobs.
Friend of privacy?  New planned Google mapping satellites will carry high definition cameras capable of facial recognition!
Recapture of Mosul Dam was great cooperative effort, but further actions await Obama's decision. Tough one but no real choice.
ISIS can only be beaten by policy of elimination and even then with difficulty.  This is historic war of barbarism v, civilization.
Looking forward to reading Paul Ryan's The Way Forward.  Ryan the most influential Republican in Congress.  Will report.
Why are CA jails  filled with largely young guilty of minor crimes? Jerry Brown, please. Vast expense, social damage. Overpaid staff too.
Will Congress act on demilitarisation of police when it reconvenes?
NSA privacy invasion bad, but nothing compared to Google.
Barbaric ISIS has few hundred US Brit & Oz  recruits, all planning to return. Secret services' no idea of identities. Huge dangers ahead.
US has historic high in people out of work.  Major changes needed to open opportunities, fix schools,or face more Fergusons.
@Rand Paul "demilitarise the police".    Mighty interesting but is it practical?    Maybe test in one big city first, but principle right.
In SF just looking many start ups, mixed successes ahead, but Stripe, by brilliant Collison brothers outstanding.

Hard to believe slave trade, not just sex, still prevalent in Africa and large parts of Middle East.  UN as-ever unconcerned and useless.
Story of lipped Nigerian girls horrifying.   8 more today!   Outrage not enough.   Only safe return, justice for perpetrators.
Story of kidnapped Nigerian girls horrifying,   Another 8 today! Outrage not enough.only safe return, justice for perpetrators.
Great day at Kentucky Derby.  A real American institution.  150,000 people having a great time, but with a lot of tradition.
Warren Buffett complains about Omaha hotel rates moving.  Thought he believed in free markets, supply and demand, etc?
Silicon Valley one day, next Miami.    What a great country of booming contrasts!     Pity most of country in between not so happy.
Google attack on NSA extreme nerve.   Google has more data on all of us and uses it.   No evidence of NSA doing this. Ethical company?
Just completing week in Silicon Vy.  Exponential increase in innovation, not just here but world wide.   Implications ( jobs?) unpredictable
Google grows more exciting.   Now hiring top academics to work on anti- aging
God bless and happy Easter for all Christians, especially those suffering persecution in many countries.

@Zarnie50 No,   Never give up.
Great morning taking young daughters to Rio2.  Fantastic animation with nice story, even if politically correct!  Idealistic , good for kids
How long before Putin moves further on Ukraine?  Kerry sounds pathetic, EU gutless.   Neighbours now terrified and seem friendless.
Stock market dive overdue, may have further to go.   Means fewer IPOs this year.   Meanwhile Alibaba getting hassled by Chinese government.
Who advised POTUS to embrace Al Sharpton on very day new scandal erupted?   Sharpton always a rogue disgraces otherwise good causes.
Microsoft moves and options for future fascinate.  Need for big clean out of bureaucracy and focus on next big tech wave.  Metadata?
Why did Al Sharpton allow FBI to wire him?   Patriotism or blackmail pressure?
Repeat Afghan election a triumph.  Country bears no resemblance to ten years ago.   Taliban reduced to small, ineffective number.

40 per cent of early deaths caused by life style.   Left alone, insurers would soon educate people eating crap, smoking, etc.
Sick of world being run by central bankers.   Where are some strong democratic political leaders?   Let rates float and watch people save.
UKIP,Farage still making progress.   Without a deal Cameron will be dead meat after 2015 elections.  Prepare for Radical Labour.
Signs Obama's pressure on Putin friends is being felt.   Should lay it on harder.   They only understand money. And warn off Baltics.
US just finished ten days campaign of political correctness. now we should not use the word bossy.  We encourage bossy bosses of both sexes.
Where will this end?   Guinness pulls out of religious parade bullied by gay orgs who try to take it over.  Hope all Irish boycott the stuff
Charter school fight leads to greater understanding and helps all education reformers.  Issue will not go away.
de Blasio attack on charter schools  major issue. Heat  being applied by few wealthy supporters flooding effective tv.  National issue soon.
777. Still think this a reminder that US and China should be working more closely on Muslim extremist threat.
World seems transfixed by 777 disappearance.  Maybe no crash but stolen, effectively hidden, perhaps in Northern Pakistan, like Bin Laden.
777crash confirms jihadists turning to make trouble for China.   Chance for US to make common cause, befriend China while Russia bullies.
Looking to punish Putin?    Easy!   Freeze or impound all cash and assets of oligarchs in US, UK, and reachable tax havens.
NYC now totally managed by leftist activists with no experience in running anything beyond protests.  Big mess ahead.
Obama should all Chinese President following today's incident and say " we both have the problem of Muslim terrorism. Can we work together?"
Charters.  How can de Blasio do this same day Obama making major effort for disadvantaged black and Latino boys.
Charters. Mayor, WHY? This hurts poor families who only want a better school for their kids!  Parents outraged. http://t.co/ZlD2J5PPDP
Education. Private sector, churches, community organizations must all support our disadvantaged youth.
POTUS right to focus on youth education. All kids deserve good full high school ed.  Huge dropout rate enlarges underclass impoverishing
USA
Pope Francis appoints brilliant Cardinal Pell from Sydney to be  no.3 power in Vatican.  Australia will miss him but world will benefit.

Best of luck to all the great films nominated for Oscars. http://t.co/ktvG6j3U3B
How long will POTUS sit out the slaughter in Kiev?  Tough, effective pressure possible. But no sign of anything.  This is a big one.
Wild winter in US, UK, etc.  no respectable evidence any of this man made climate change in spite of blindly ignorant politicians.
$90 for 100& 24/7 tv channels expensive? Try family outing two hour movie and compare.
Great partnership between spotify and Times of London. Fabulous tone quality.  I link spotify to my jambox.
Interesting fact.  Last 20 yrs life expectancy for women not high school graduated  has declined five years, three for men.
POTUS has called ed conference at White House this Thursday.  Hope a real effort coming with big measures.  We'll see.
Answers lie in education, where we've gone way backwards, and deregulating everywhere to allow entrepreneurship to restart. Fast too.
US recovery third straight with no job increase.  Great, enriching, innovations pushing millions out of work force.   Just starting.
UK proposing 9 hour school days, many fewer holidays.9 hrs to include homework sport etc. polls show very popular especially working mothers
Recent silence due bad back accident and other distractions.
Keenly awaiting next week's State of the Union address. Opportunity for launching real education initiatives to give equal opportunity.
Great edit in WSJ attacking DOJ for war on Apple.  Outrageous process  likely to be appealed forever.
Australia in deep economic trouble left by last six year wildly incompetent govt. New govt must take quick, painful actions.
Australia surrounded by vast gas and oil deposits. Huge developments financed by Chinese, Japanese contracts while local industries closing.
Amid Xmas extravagance and festivities, Christians should pray for millions of fellow believers being killed and persecuted in Middle East.
Just landing in Australia after endless flight.  Worth it. What's better than family Xmas, even in heat wave?
Bloomberg seems busy talking about his achievements I Why? History will do it.  Greatest mayor yet, future now frightening.
2013 ends with Paul Ryan the most respected and outstanding Republican. Principled and modest.  Trusted by all sides.
Much excitement about @Storyful. Wonderful company doing big things in digital content and video, will be a great asset to @newscorp .
Huge changes as Putin snares Ukraine after complete EU incompetence. Maybe mass protesters can hold out.
Deflation worrying world. Energy glut, disruptive techs, destroy skilled jobs.  Answer: deregulate everywhere possible, open opportunities.
NYTimes says I'm most eligible bachelor!   Wish I was forty years younger.
Money funded and raised by Mike Milken to cure prostrate cancer over twenty years sees annual death rate down from 150,000 to 29,000.
Pope Francis messages great and needed, but forgets free markets, with all their faults, have recently lifted one billion out of poverty.
Congratulations to new Twitter director.  Let's hope she does not repeat Nokia accomplishment!
Good US and UK figures this week.   Don't trust them until we see much more.  People still having  hard times. Rich richer, poor poorer.
US moving ever- faster to class society.  Equal opportunity ideal must be restored and progress made or all will suffer.
Watch new Merkel govt take mighty Germany into gentle decline. EU fast becoming leaderless bureaucratic quagmire.
Monterey Aquarium next to famous Cannery Row must be one of best in nation.    Loved it, as did party of kids. No more deep diving!
Of course Washington also very great president.  Without him and LINCOLN no US today. Few other greats & plenty of well- meaning disasters.
Great time to be reading Rich Lowry's fascinating new             

Lincoln Unbound.  Surely our greatest, most interesting president.
Happy Thanksgiving all.  Busy teaching young generation it's full meaning.
Pity no action this year on immigration. Obama working with Republicans gives hope for real action early 2014, otherwise take years.
Thanks for all for attending WSJ CEO conference, especially President.
WSJ  CEO conference great success. Plenty of worries. Obama, Christie, Ryan very impressive, but Summers knockout with sheer brilliance.
Pope Francis revitalising Church worldwide with wonderful challenging statements and actions. Certainly making me, like others, rethink much
Looks like QE keeps going for long time, just making rich richer leaving masses behind, also serious global dislocations.

@HiBerke Hey, thanks for stopping by!  Was fun to get to chat for a bit!
@lizsavery Sorry to hear, but we're very happy w/ launch of both apps.  90% of the folks who used 4SQ to checkin are now using Swarm :)

He planned to open a branch of his'Indian Accent,' arguably India's finest restaurant. Landlord,however,declined from fear of 'alien aromas'

袁岳: 中国高等教育的崩溃特征:1资源错置，让社会最需要的专科成了砖科；2既不通识又无技能，让本科成了笨科；3让对就职最没信心的部分同学以考研为缓刑，让硕士中满是缩士；4最迷茫的考试高人透过直博稀释了最需方向感的博士生，让博士生成了薄识生；5如此加工出有任教资格而无任教灵魂的叫兽
【环球时报评香港】時報又指無需要以放大鏡偵察香港的離心，由於內地的體制在輿論層面不如香港靈活，會催生出香港一些人故意用尖銳的聲音和行動刺激內地，以尋求他們的利益最大化。這其實是一種“撒嬌”，內地應當將它們看透，無必要事事反應，與之互動。http://t.co/lI000DsC45
于建嵘在中央党校的社会发展问题高端论坛发言：当前政治上的问题，主要是政法派系企图保持并扩大他们在前十年因维稳获得的权势，与左势力勾结，故意夸大社会对立，将民众的维权抗争及要求官员公开财产政治化，将知识界要求落实宪法建立法治国家敌对化。但无论他们如何搬弄是非，民主法治大势不可改变。

于建嵘：1、意识形态混乱，有人试图以资社之争，而掩盖社会现实问题；2、强权部门夸大敌情，以求获得更大镇压权力；3、司法改革刚有起步，又受到反宪政思潮影响；3、民生政策没有新招，非法强拆和强征更为严重；4、反腐败虽有动作，却又将要求公开视为犯罪。深为虑。

胡锡进：中国在朝着依法治国的方向前进，这里的法，首先是宪法。中国已经不存在宪法和法律重不重要，该不该依法治国的实际争论。但“宪政”的提出背景，这个概念在中国形成影响的过程，使它拥有了与中国主流政治发展相悖的特殊政治含义。因此我支持依法治国，支持忠诚宪法，但反对追随宪政提法。

新浪头条新闻:【首都机场爆炸者引爆前曾提醒周围人群】昨日18时24分，北京首都机场T3航站楼B出口外，一名山东籍残疾男子引爆自制爆炸装置，造成本人受伤，现场无其他人员伤亡。经警方初步核实，该男子曾因觉得受到不公正对待，上访多年。有目击者称，男子在引爆炸弹前曾提醒周围人躲避。
假装在纽约:制造首都机场T3爆炸的冀中星，05年在东莞被治安员殴打致终生残废。还有厦门陈水总。江西钱明奇。过去十年，有多少被蛮横对待无路可走的底层百姓，就有多少随时会引爆的地雷埋伏在我们周围。关心他们的命运就是关心我们自己，多一次公正的对待，这个早就是雷区的国家就少一颗地雷。

湖南省高级人民法院新闻发言人曾鼎新：因为案卷材料中没有曾成杰的二女儿、儿子的联系方式，故当日执行后法院将执行通知书邮寄送达曾的大女婿。但是：1）曾太太、大女儿在牢里，是否见到了曾成杰最后一面？2）邮寄给女婿，收到时已处决，来不及假面，3）二女儿联系方式问曾便知，上微博问律师都行！

【决不放弃见亲属最后一面！！！】我是李开复。如果有一日，我被判死刑，当法官告知有权会见亲属时，我保证我绝对会要求会见亲属。若被处决后，法院宣布我未提出此要求，必然是谎言。转发本微博并做出你的承诺，以防失去最后见亲人的机会。
长沙市中级人民法院发微博称：今天由于微博管理人员对刑事法律学习钻研不够，想当然办事，面对网上舆论不淡定，导致发出了一条错误信息并在领导发现后删除。我们对一线工作人员提出了严厉了批评。特此向网友和公众道歉。今后工作中我们将要求编发信息的人员加强学习，不再犯类似错误。欢迎继续监督。
长沙市中级人民法院发微博称：7月12日上午，长沙市中级人民法院在对罪犯曾成杰执行死刑前验明正身时，法官告知其有权会见亲属，但罪犯曾成杰并没有提出此要求，在其遗言中也没有提出。
长沙市中级人民法院发微博称：“法律没有明文规定，对犯人执行死刑时，犯人必须跟亲人见面。” 之后法院删除该微博。中华人民共和国刑事诉讼法第四百二十三条明确规定： 第一审人民法院在执行死刑前，应当告知罪犯有权会见其近亲属。罪犯近亲属申请会见的，人民法院应当准许，并及时安排会见。

@cpen no, it's more like I've been working all day and am getting punchy.
@cpen @Travel_Jim I loved Roger Moore in Spectre Brocken but still think Daniel Craig is the best Bond. 
(Sorry, Sunday night and whatnot).
@cpen @RachyMills @WillStick @jimprosser @RachaelRad so true.  And yet, free honey.

@ashedryden I'll follow-up with the team on this right now.
@BuckeyeRidley you know, it's been on my list right under sewing that button back on my shirt and changing that hard to reach lightbulb.
@dvnix @AngryBlackLady @KevinRobinette we are on this in a couple different ways. I'd prefer to leave it at that here. Thanks very much.
@BuckeyeRidley @Support ok, thanks. Let me know if it happens again, yeah? Hope you're well.
@BuckeyeRidley  @Support hey Matt. Issues with refreshing the app itself (from the App Store) or with updating your home timeline, etc? Thks
@CrossFit a singlet? Maybe. That singlet? No.
@thesonjake in "the future"
@mdb during the Super Bowl  halftime show? Yes.
Oy. At LEAST hold the bow in the middle!  https://t.co/3nbROkRN74
@wickman @levie freaky Friday. Next, Aaron misuses an esoteric word in a reply to @noradio
@chanian @leftparen @twitter @cbrumelle and Ian was in his...um... Jeez, what phase would you call that, Ian?
@Stammy hmmm...
some elegant solutions have an absence of those! (Both in the solution itself & the process of arriving at it, I'd imagine)
@rodolfor I don't disagree with that.
Good products solve an existing human problem. Great products make good products feel like an existing human problem.
@samfbiddle @cpen now you've ruined the surprise!

@dohertyjf you will be further surprised/delighted how much LESS you will have to follow-up on the team's lack of context later on.
@CrossFit @CrossFitGames that is just ridiculous height. Crazy.
@LouisXavierL @beccanalia beautiful
@martharoldos @twitter @Polificcion @Diana_Amores @carlitoswayec I'll make sure this is being looked at. Thanks for the attention.

@pmarca @davealevine that's always been my experience with the "i don't need more than a few hours" crowd. Lights out shortly after lunch.
@dohertyjf context is everything.
@pmarca but Ben's book is already for my life.  Oh! You mean for my other life.  Just bought it.  Thanks for the tip.
@pmarca huh, I'm totally unfamiliar with it. Moving to the head of the "non-fiction" pile.
@vpostrel @pmarca I had thought Tim simply meant it as a good band name, Six Californias, and if you stop there it's not a bad idea at all
@ericvishria @benchmark @karaswisher congratulations, Eric.  Exciting news!
@elizabeth pro tip:

@kevinweil
@adambain @spencerrascoff @vineapp agreed. Pinot's "skater girl" Vine is fantastic, and Zach's balloon/tshirt Vine is a classic.
@narendra @omid that's crazy. Great work.
@jeffweiner ok, now you do something awesome for me.  Go ahead, I'll wait right here.

@Jason One can't help wonder what might be possible if the creator of your third use case put their skills to use on a tour of the d'orsay.
@jake_mccracken yeah, I had a similar reaction.
@kpk everybody assumes you have to be walking around.  That's not the use case.
@dens Real estate sign in yard, future of photo sharing, etc. Phone, not glasses!
@kylesamani disagree. You only need a phone. Wearable not a requirement.
@AndrewDinsdale @JonBeebe great simple example and super fun for parent-child outing
@dansinker I'm thinking kings like real estate for sale, museum tours, national park hiking etc. On and on!
@gaberivera uh oh. :)
@stunt_penguin yes. Hopefully, @elonmusk is on that.

@TnR4110 thank you for your note, your concern and your interest. Every American should be giving this issue a lot of thought. Good night.
@TnR4110 sorry I don't have any easy answers. I can assure you that this problem has my full attention and good effort each and every day.
@TnR4110 I would suggest we focus on what will work to make universal coverage affordable and steer our health care system to that place.

@TnR4110 we can argue whether or not these additional costs are the right approach, but we can't argue that people w/o insurance is good!

@TnR4110 thank you for your note, your concern and your interest. Every American should be giving this issue a lot of thought. Good night.
@TnR4110 sorry I don't have any easy answers. I can assure you that this problem has my full attention and good effort each and every day.
@TnR4110 I would suggest we focus on what will work to make universal coverage affordable and steer our health care system to that place.
@TnR4110 the ACA is a rough start.  Much work needs to be done to improve and complete a hastily constructed and poorly launched program.
@TnR4110 I am not satisfied with where we are at all. Nobody is going to "win" in the current structure...including insurance companies.
@TnR4110 we can argue whether or not these additional costs are the right approach, but we can't argue that people w/o insurance is good!
@TnR4110 ...taxes, equalizing rates for most people, fewer benefit options and smaller provider networks to lower costs.
@TnR4110 the result of covering more people is that the burden for that cost falls on the rest of Americans...the cost gets spread via...
@TnR4110 while the ACA increases the number of people who have insurance, it does very little to control the underlying cost of care.
