RT @jzieger: @ramez Lyft for police officers--rate the cop after each interaction.
@jzieger Yeah. That's just where my head was going.
Community ratings and reviews on cops.
Tech can play a big role in improving policing while reducing abuse. 

But it's not in a vacuum. Tech amplifies govt style and vice versa.
@sblackmoore Yeah. Maybe. We elect the sherrif in a lot of counties. But not the city chief of police. Or the state patrol regional head.
Imagine a world where most police officers were chosen by the community they policed. And answerable to it. 

How would we build that?
@sblackmoore Yeah. You would think that.
I've never bought into the libertarian fantasy of privatized police forces.

I do find myself fantasizing now about community policing.
@sblackmoore They're thinking "control the situation" instead of "calm the situation" or "defend the rights of these citizens"

@Robertwaldeck Usually turned on only during interactions. < 10% of the day, if that. 

And yes, but not vice versa at present. @harper

RT @jzieger: @ramez Lyft for police officers--rate the cop after each interaction.
@jzieger Yeah. That's just where my head was going.
Community ratings and reviews on cops.
Tech can play a big role in improving policing while reducing abuse. 

But it's not in a vacuum. Tech amplifies govt style and vice versa.
@sblackmoore Yeah. Maybe. We elect the sherrif in a lot of counties. But not the city chief of police. Or the state patrol regional head.
Imagine a world where most police officers were chosen by the community they policed. And answerable to it. 

How would we build that?
@sblackmoore Yeah. You would think that.
I've never bought into the libertarian fantasy of privatized police forces.

I do find myself fantasizing now about community policing.
@sblackmoore They're thinking "control the situation" instead of "calm the situation" or "defend the rights of these citizens"
Folks should look at @WesleyLowery's tweets now. 

It's clear, tonight, (again) the #Ferguson police are the ones escalating the situation.

@Robertwaldeck @harper I'm oversimplifying. But video has been more successfully used internally by departments than by defendants.
@Robertwaldeck Usually turned on only during interactions. < 10% of the day, if that. 

And yes, but not vice versa at present. @harper
@Robertwaldeck @harper Less than $100 / officer per year for the raw storage cost of a year's video.

NBC is already screwing up the story. Nothing about cops penning everyone in? Disproportionate response? #Ferguson http://t.co/1JiEcXQ1b5
@Gypsy___Dave It got tense before that. As a result of cops forming up in lines, penning everyone into a small space. Before that, calm.
Tomorrow you'll see a headline about tonight's #Ferguson protests turning violent.

Remember it was peaceful tonight until the cops provoked
RT @WesleyLowery: Reporter face down in road being arrested. Tried to take picture. Officer shoves me
RT @jcenters: There's only one first amendment zone and it's called the United States.
RT @xor: Police urgently corralling media in #Ferguson to "designated" first amendment zones right now does not bode well.
@armandokirwin Hmm. Going to go to bed pondering this.
@marshray @eqe Yes. By "citizen owned" I really mean that we can pull data of our own interactions with cops.
@SofiaSamatar Rock on, Sofia.
RT @SofiaSamatar: shouts to profs with a new semester starting soon! who's going to talk about #Ferguson on the first day? all of us? oh go…
RT @mattdpearce: Police line starts strobing me as I take this picture. http://t.co/WokdymzJkd
RT @ryanjreilly: "Get that camera out of my fucking face." -- officer who pointed gun at protestors #Ferguson
RT @pmarca: @ramez You are probably already familiar with this but same genre, different category: http://t.co/QNGx6L8Tdk
@pmarca Was just talking to a friend from Nigeria about the need for something similar there.
@pmarca That makes me super happy. Now I'm dreaming of extensions to it.
Some teens are apparently building "Yelp to Rate Police" Excellent. RT @pmarca: @ramez http://t.co/o1ykQHc4bm
@pmarca Well, whaddaya know. Awesome.
@sblackmoore Yeah. Your point about small towns is good. And in big cities, also an issue with different neighborhoods.
RT @jzieger: @ramez Lyft for police officers--rate the cop after each interaction.
@jzieger Yeah. That's just where my head was going.
Community ratings and reviews on cops.
Tech can play a big role in improving policing while reducing abuse. 

But it's not in a vacuum. Tech amplifies govt style and vice versa.
@sblackmoore Yeah. Maybe. We elect the sherrif in a lot of counties. But not the city chief of police. Or the state patrol regional head.
Imagine a world where most police officers were chosen by the community they policed. And answerable to it. 

How would we build that?
@sblackmoore Yeah. You would think that.
I've never bought into the libertarian fantasy of privatized police forces.

I do find myself fantasizing now about community policing.
@sblackmoore They're thinking "control the situation" instead of "calm the situation" or "defend the rights of these citizens"
Folks should look at @WesleyLowery's tweets now. 

It's clear, tonight, (again) the #Ferguson police are the ones escalating the situation.
Perhaps police forces should also be "of the people, by the people, and for the people."
RT @WesleyLowery: For context, police REFUSED to collect security cameras / investigate destruction at stores that were looted last week.
RT @WesleyLowery: Not a joke, police now claiming that they cleared everyone into street to "protect" McDonalds/private property. There was…
RT @WesleyLowery: Police randomly clearing parking lots. Pushing people INTO the street. No explanation
RT @Slate: It has been a peaceful night in #Ferguson so far: http://t.co/2Ud0xfdTmU http://t.co/6rzONAB0ln
@Robertwaldeck Now you're just talking circularly.  Goodnight.
@Robertwaldeck @harper The ACLU guide is pretty sensible. You can capture lots, then toss out periods w/ e.g. no arrests or complaints.
@Robertwaldeck @harper Always on is tractable. Maybe 2TB of data per year / officer. That costs about $200. And we can throw away some.
@Robertwaldeck @harper The ACLU policy paper on this is pretty solid, and should be a win/win: http://t.co/r3u62fEvcg
@Robertwaldeck @harper I'm oversimplifying. But video has been more successfully used internally by departments than by defendants.
@Robertwaldeck Usually turned on only during interactions. < 10% of the day, if that. 

And yes, but not vice versa at present. @harper
@Robertwaldeck @harper Less than $100 / officer per year for the raw storage cost of a year's video.
@Robertwaldeck @harper At min, you should be able to request video for an interaction you had with an officer. Can't noww.
RT @astepanovich: Under our Constitution, I shouldn't be scared to tell you to go fuck yourself when appropriate. http://t.co/MtBscyJaWr
@AndrewLiptak It's not public record. In general, you don't have access to it, even if it's a recording of you.
@houtopia Yes, I think it would as well. And would increase the number. And improve the behavior of people they interact with.
@craigb @j4cob Yeah, in that case it was probably wrong. Here's another example: http://t.co/5xHVEF9Lam
@BenReser @ioerror Actually, that is probably not a nametag. See a similar example (with clear documentation) here: http://t.co/5xHVEF9Lam
Cameras worn by cops have reduced cop violence.

But the video is always property of police. That should change. Should be citizen-owned.
RT @ezraklein: Imagine if the police in #Ferguson were wearing body cameras and the feeds were accessible to citizens: http://t.co/KEO9xS9z…
RT @mattyglesias: Does anyone look at what's been happening in #ferguson and wish more people were carrying guns?
RT @solobasssteve: The most brilliant women I know are unsure of their brilliance. 

The most mediocre men I know are convinced of theirs. …
RT @BoingBoing: And now, the GIF: CNN anchor on #Ferguson: 'Why not, perhaps, use water cannons?' http://t.co/LoRRue2J15 http://t.co/laZ74Y…
RT @voxdotcom: Poll: White people think the Michael Brown investigation is going fine http://t.co/eoHKhajbDL http://t.co/HJRPA7liDx
RT @normative: Many populations REALLY CAN expect to be targeted by authorities only in  response and proportion to actual misconduct...
RT @normative: There's a parallel between racial disparity in polls on Ferguson & "nothing to hide" reactions to mass surveillance...
@KateElliottSFF Kate!!!! So great to meet you as well! And you did get Molly's name right! Please let us know if you're ever in Seattle!
@Terrapolis21 Email me. mez@morethanhuman.org
@Terrapolis21 Thanks so much.
@gregsasso Or like they wanted to get clicks. @scalzi
@scalzi After reading it again, more calmly: The headline writer did the cop no favors. The op-ed is bad. The headline is worse.
RT @WesleyLowery: Ferguson is again asking people to stay home at night, says it will get cameras for its police force http://t.co/X5uQ9bc2…
@craigb @j4cob Thanks. Was going off the article, Zooming in on photo, still not sure. Cops have refused to give names & badge numbers there
@smellthefuture Thanks. Was going off the article. Zooming in on photo, still not sure.
Federal Inspector Generals say White House is blocking access to records they need to do their jobs. #transparency  http://t.co/AfyYJm2Vvk
Cops in #Ferguson are operating without nametags or badges.  Total impunity. 

That should be illegal. http://t.co/lsHmiGZyNA

https://t.co/AxUizwZKu2 The client-server ScalaJS example I used for my @ScalaByTheBay session. Just clone and sbt ~re-start to see it work!
https://t.co/sCm3nQKjnC My slides for scalabythebay. Unfortunately, my own recording failed, so we'll have to wait for the organizers' =)
@mr_mig_by @propensive Nope but @khrabrov or @swartzrock probably does =P
@mr_mig_by @propensive my audio recording crashed =< going to have to wait till I can get it from the organizers or they publish it =P
@ericpeters Yeah, I haven't managed to keep them up with changes =/ Maybe I should just remove them till I get auto-linked docs working
http://t.co/PoCvRuv3JD The new version of Scala.js is 1.3-3.3 times faster than the previous, making it about 3-6x faster than CPython
What's the difference between a "parametrized" or "table-driven" test, and a test with an List of tuples and a for-loop running over them?
It's amazing the "features" I advertise don't live together in any existing library. Even excluding the Scala.js stuff!
https://t.co/SAzgB3iRZf published uPickle 0.2.0 for Scala/Scala.js: boilerplate-free pickling, with specified behavior, and even docs!

@xeno_by @milessabin @mandubian @heathercmiller At least with macros once compilation stops, everything freezes and becomes sane/static
@xeno_by @milessabin @mandubian @heathercmiller There's another thing that macros are more principled than: runtime reflection/introspection
@stanchme @den_sh I'd say that the surface syntax is pretty immaterial; they don't even look like strings now because of syntax highlighting
@erikrozendaal @StOnSoftware Yeah, what does "injection attack" mean anyway? It only deserializes what you ask it to, *statically*, no Anys
https://t.co/wSoKFxY4WG Type-safe, statically-checked Ajax calls between your Scala-JS and Scala-JVM applications!
@extempore2 I've been working on https://t.co/SAzgB3iRZf, goal being to be completely reflection-free and work in Scala.js =) Still WIP
Looking back at http://t.co/7N6K4Ols7m it always impresses me how far you can go with #scalajs, even back in the pre-0.1.0 days
@pedrofurla @xuwei_k #shapeless already works https://t.co/XIZNaKfGe7, just waiting for alexander-myltsev to put it up somewhere =)
https://t.co/5LIfsAzM71 Just published Scalatags 0.3.4: the worlds smallest, fastest, safest, embedablest, flexiblest  templating library!
@AdamRMurray I've looked at that screenshot a dozen times and only just noticed that!
#scalajs is ~25x slower than Scala on the JVM. On the bright side, that means we're ~2x faster than CPython!

@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman work is the content, not the skill itself.
@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman it's a "terrible idea" to want to improve a skill as a hobby

@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman several folks in thread have said this approach allows them *more* time to pursue outside hobbies
@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman about pressure is valid, but I'm not a huge fan of you approaching convo saying it was "terrible"
@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman idk, would you criticize a novelist for writing letters to friends? I think the point you made...
@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman work is the content, not the skill itself.
@jgschraiber @jeresig @kara_woo @kwbroman it's a "terrible idea" to want to improve a skill as a hobby

@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev https://t.co/FcWvuVWWm1 that calls https://t.co/TmmROcRFLu which calls https://t.co/nggtmSkAIs which calls …
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev pkg_resources is the part of easy_install that does the sys.path manipulation.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That issue isn’t specific to six, it’s more of a “how does setuptools depend on things” issue.
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough This is in fact a planned feature for that library. Probably will tackle that next after versioning.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev but honestly, my guess is that it’d be saner to make a new runtime API instead.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev This needs solved - https://t.co/VbTgprO4BS
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The problem of course, is setuptools needs it available to install itself.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You can install binary distributions using pip without ever installing setuptools.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev I know for a fact that this would fail on Ubuntu Precise if installed from a Wheel right now!
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev More importantly, how often do you look at it and know what it should be to know it would be wrong.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You probably get into that case and don’t realize it, how often do people look at the version number?
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev “sqlalchemy 1.5.3” doesn’t tell you anything if ``import sqlalchemy`` is actually giving you 2.0.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That *should* be a distribution version, but reality means it breaks down too often IMO.

@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The realities of our packaging toolchain is far from ideal though :(
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough For the record, I think the “look at installation metadata” is the correct way, in an ideal world.
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall correctly, distutils doesnt even leave trace of what *distributions* were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall, by default setuptools and distutils leave no trace of what files were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze Sometimes.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze It is though. There is nothing binding the metadata to a module name other than convention.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze package/module is the only thing that counts when answering “What code version am I running”.

@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough When things break and people work around them, there’s a fairly high chance I’ll hear about it at some point.
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes pip/PyPI do not read a __version__.
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Yea, but I don’t get to control what users do. I either get confused when versions don’t match or I do it my way
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes I do that too, it works fine ;)
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Maybe so, but I live in the real world where __version__ works 100% of the time to say what version is imported
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough PYTHONPATH breaks it, so does the implicit “.” on sys.path if you happen to be in a directory with pkg in it
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Doesn’t work correctly, it tells you what pkg_resources thinks is installed. Not what you’ve imported.
@chrismcdonough Python the language has no concept of a distribution.
@regebro @chrismcdonough @fschulze Why wouldn’t you? Runtime inspection of version imported is super useful.
@chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze I misunderstood then, I still disagree, Python does this itself, see for example __file__ and __module__

@dgouldin @bitprophet @gassee I think the “and team owners keep 95% of revenue” is an important part here.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not exactly Python fault, but it’s an inevitable outcome, and the original bad migration plan was pain
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW you had things on PyPI that worked on 2.x, new users wanted to use 3.x, would open tickets/demand ports.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There’s also the “pitting new users vs existing users against each other” angle which I think was a sore spot.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s why I’m careful to always say I think that folks are attempting to close the gap :)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not really the same thing as it only helps things that *can* be backported. Also…
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes I think a mistake was made, but steps are being made to fix it. (And Python 3 itself isn’t the mistake IMO)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes To be clear though, this isn’t a value judgement on the Python dev.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW, the only considered migration path was one shot, do it once and never go back.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Honestly, I think it all stems from the fact that Python ruled out single source from the beginning.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Which says “No new features for you unless you do a bunch of work”, but these new users, they get new features
@palendae Ironically that’s how long people will be using Python 2.x in production too :V
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes But I think that Python learned it’s lesson too, and is taking steps to hopefully remediate.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There is a definite feeling that Python was taking it’s current users for granted. It’s not just about support

@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev https://t.co/FcWvuVWWm1 that calls https://t.co/TmmROcRFLu which calls https://t.co/nggtmSkAIs which calls …
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev pkg_resources is the part of easy_install that does the sys.path manipulation.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That issue isn’t specific to six, it’s more of a “how does setuptools depend on things” issue.
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough This is in fact a planned feature for that library. Probably will tackle that next after versioning.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev but honestly, my guess is that it’d be saner to make a new runtime API instead.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev This needs solved - https://t.co/VbTgprO4BS
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The problem of course, is setuptools needs it available to install itself.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You can install binary distributions using pip without ever installing setuptools.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev I know for a fact that this would fail on Ubuntu Precise if installed from a Wheel right now!
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev More importantly, how often do you look at it and know what it should be to know it would be wrong.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You probably get into that case and don’t realize it, how often do people look at the version number?
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev “sqlalchemy 1.5.3” doesn’t tell you anything if ``import sqlalchemy`` is actually giving you 2.0.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That *should* be a distribution version, but reality means it breaks down too often IMO.

@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The realities of our packaging toolchain is far from ideal though :(
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough For the record, I think the “look at installation metadata” is the correct way, in an ideal world.
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall correctly, distutils doesnt even leave trace of what *distributions* were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall, by default setuptools and distutils leave no trace of what files were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze Sometimes.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze It is though. There is nothing binding the metadata to a module name other than convention.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze package/module is the only thing that counts when answering “What code version am I running”.

@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough When things break and people work around them, there’s a fairly high chance I’ll hear about it at some point.
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes pip/PyPI do not read a __version__.
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Yea, but I don’t get to control what users do. I either get confused when versions don’t match or I do it my way
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes I do that too, it works fine ;)
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Maybe so, but I live in the real world where __version__ works 100% of the time to say what version is imported
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough PYTHONPATH breaks it, so does the implicit “.” on sys.path if you happen to be in a directory with pkg in it
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Doesn’t work correctly, it tells you what pkg_resources thinks is installed. Not what you’ve imported.
@chrismcdonough Python the language has no concept of a distribution.
@regebro @chrismcdonough @fschulze Why wouldn’t you? Runtime inspection of version imported is super useful.
@chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze I misunderstood then, I still disagree, Python does this itself, see for example __file__ and __module__
@chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze How is __version__ not logically global.

@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes @mitsuhiko @edschofield @regebro @gutworth Python 2.8 that has python-future? *ducks*
@dgouldin @bitprophet @gassee I think the “and team owners keep 95% of revenue” is an important part here.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not exactly Python fault, but it’s an inevitable outcome, and the original bad migration plan was pain
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW you had things on PyPI that worked on 2.x, new users wanted to use 3.x, would open tickets/demand ports.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There’s also the “pitting new users vs existing users against each other” angle which I think was a sore spot.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s why I’m careful to always say I think that folks are attempting to close the gap :)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not really the same thing as it only helps things that *can* be backported. Also…
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes I think a mistake was made, but steps are being made to fix it. (And Python 3 itself isn’t the mistake IMO)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes To be clear though, this isn’t a value judgement on the Python dev.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW, the only considered migration path was one shot, do it once and never go back.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Honestly, I think it all stems from the fact that Python ruled out single source from the beginning.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Which says “No new features for you unless you do a bunch of work”, but these new users, they get new features
@palendae Ironically that’s how long people will be using Python 2.x in production too :V
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes But I think that Python learned it’s lesson too, and is taking steps to hopefully remediate.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There is a definite feeling that Python was taking it’s current users for granted. It’s not just about support

@dstufft @chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev never mind the fact that importing pkg_resources is slow as hell since it walks the directories.

@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev https://t.co/FcWvuVWWm1 that calls https://t.co/TmmROcRFLu which calls https://t.co/nggtmSkAIs which calls …
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev pkg_resources is the part of easy_install that does the sys.path manipulation.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That issue isn’t specific to six, it’s more of a “how does setuptools depend on things” issue.
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough This is in fact a planned feature for that library. Probably will tackle that next after versioning.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev but honestly, my guess is that it’d be saner to make a new runtime API instead.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev This needs solved - https://t.co/VbTgprO4BS
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The problem of course, is setuptools needs it available to install itself.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You can install binary distributions using pip without ever installing setuptools.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev I know for a fact that this would fail on Ubuntu Precise if installed from a Wheel right now!
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev More importantly, how often do you look at it and know what it should be to know it would be wrong.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev You probably get into that case and don’t realize it, how often do people look at the version number?
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev “sqlalchemy 1.5.3” doesn’t tell you anything if ``import sqlalchemy`` is actually giving you 2.0.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev That *should* be a distribution version, but reality means it breaks down too often IMO.
@chrismcdonough @ncoghlan_dev I care about “what is the unique identifier to represent the code I’m executing”.

@jackfrombkln @samkottler Well the cops have fancier gear, that’s progress for someone?
@glyph But if I say it’s because they were jerks then I don’t have to actually be nice to people!
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough The realities of our packaging toolchain is far from ideal though :(
@ncoghlan_dev @chrismcdonough For the record, I think the “look at installation metadata” is the correct way, in an ideal world.
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall correctly, distutils doesnt even leave trace of what *distributions* were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze If I recall, by default setuptools and distutils leave no trace of what files were installed
@ionelmc @chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze Sometimes.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze It is though. There is nothing binding the metadata to a module name other than convention.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze package/module is the only thing that counts when answering “What code version am I running”.
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze Because until there is first class distribution support in Python, …
@chrismcdonough @ionelmc @regebro @fschulze Maybe that’s the version you care about, it’s not the one I care about ;)

@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough When things break and people work around them, there’s a fairly high chance I’ll hear about it at some point.
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes pip/PyPI do not read a __version__.
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Yea, but I don’t get to control what users do. I either get confused when versions don’t match or I do it my way
@chrismcdonough @brandon_rhodes I do that too, it works fine ;)
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Maybe so, but I live in the real world where __version__ works 100% of the time to say what version is imported
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough PYTHONPATH breaks it, so does the implicit “.” on sys.path if you happen to be in a directory with pkg in it
@mitsuhiko @chrismcdonough Doesn’t work correctly, it tells you what pkg_resources thinks is installed. Not what you’ve imported.
@chrismcdonough Python the language has no concept of a distribution.
@regebro @chrismcdonough @fschulze Why wouldn’t you? Runtime inspection of version imported is super useful.
@chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze I misunderstood then, I still disagree, Python does this itself, see for example __file__ and __module__
@chrismcdonough @regebro @fschulze How is __version__ not logically global.

@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes @mitsuhiko @edschofield @regebro @gutworth Python 2.8 that has python-future? *ducks*
@dgouldin @bitprophet @gassee I think the “and team owners keep 95% of revenue” is an important part here.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not exactly Python fault, but it’s an inevitable outcome, and the original bad migration plan was pain
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW you had things on PyPI that worked on 2.x, new users wanted to use 3.x, would open tickets/demand ports.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There’s also the “pitting new users vs existing users against each other” angle which I think was a sore spot.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s why I’m careful to always say I think that folks are attempting to close the gap :)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes That’s not really the same thing as it only helps things that *can* be backported. Also…
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes I think a mistake was made, but steps are being made to fix it. (And Python 3 itself isn’t the mistake IMO)
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes To be clear though, this isn’t a value judgement on the Python dev.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes IOW, the only considered migration path was one shot, do it once and never go back.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Honestly, I think it all stems from the fact that Python ruled out single source from the beginning.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes Which says “No new features for you unless you do a bunch of work”, but these new users, they get new features
@palendae Ironically that’s how long people will be using Python 2.x in production too :V
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes But I think that Python learned it’s lesson too, and is taking steps to hopefully remediate.
@ncoghlan_dev @brandon_rhodes There is a definite feeling that Python was taking it’s current users for granted. It’s not just about support

@cshirky As a prof doing MOOC w/Udacity, I say Hi Ed needs reshaping. MOOCs r experiments. Many will fail-that's ok. But we need to change.
@tylrfishr @ktzhu @udacity Nah, Udacity obviously decided you were unsuited. It works for me. (But what do i know?)

@andybudd My team instituted a UE Requirements Doc (UERD) required before any product team could start (joining Mktng's MRD & Engnr's ERD)
@andybudd  My early business cards 93-94 listed me as Apple Fellow & User Experience Architect.  (When I became VP, the UE title went away)
In 1993 Apple's UE team = me, Tom Erickson, Harry Sadler--1st use of "user experience" (I think). We said UE.  I don't know who made it UX.
@andybudd @rishil I joined Apple in 1993 & decided its user experience was going downhill. I enlisted a team:We named it UE Architects.
@pfilbert The real question: Is office 365 better than Google Docs? (That's a low-barrier: Google Docs remains half-finished)
Security experts wonder why we don't do updates-12 clicks! Good design wd package questions into one form: we could answer all at once.
I hate updates. Office Mac: 12 clicks + password. 8 diff dialog boxes. + 2 clicks to restart closed apps. (accepted terms w/out reading)

@johnmaeda You forgot the word "great" as in "great designers." My complaint is that (non great) Google designers reduce the great features.

No more seeing where my spouse is located on the map ,even with her permission.  The list goes on and on. Yes some things are much improved.
Ah Google maps. How do you frustrate me? Let me count the ways. You deleted multiple stops o a trip. Difficult to find "my places." etc.
@pelavarre Touché -- you are correct. But i have a love/hate relationship to 140 characters. So much to say, so few characters to say it.
I'm happy to provide examples of problems w maps. the goal is improvement. I would prefer email-email allows longer messages. don@jnd.org

@justintroutman @thegrugq @SteveBellovin The more secure we make security, the less secure the system becomes (e.g. people write the codes)
@thegrugq @justintroutman @SteveBellovin .AI brilliant solution: hardcode correct security codes. Easier for all: programmer, user, thief
@justintroutman @SteveBellovin Tesler’s Law: making it easier for user requires more code. And vice-versa. Total complexity is constant.

@ppk007 @jnd1er The accusation that I was a creationist was not meant as a compliment. But it should be: designers create.

@justintroutman @thegrugq @SteveBellovin. I believe passwords are unworkable: we need physical devices + secondary info-bio or passcode
@justintroutman @thegrugq @SteveBellovin The more secure we make security, the less secure the system becomes (e.g. people write the codes)
@thegrugq @justintroutman @SteveBellovin .AI brilliant solution: hardcode correct security codes. Easier for all: programmer, user, thief
@justintroutman @SteveBellovin Tesler’s Law: making it easier for user requires more code. And vice-versa. Total complexity is constant.
@justintroutman @SteveBellovin I champion  understandably in Security & Elsewhere. BUT Remember tesler’s law — next post.

DOET MOOC. No talking heads. No lectures. A minimum of talking hands. Engaging 1 -2 minute videos. Many projects. Many reflection points.

"Maps" is eerie: I'm walking around my property and can see it in sat. view, twisting as I walk because of the compass.
Compass reads either magnetic or true north. ("True" setting uses GPS data only to compute offset.)
New iPhone 3G S compass is cool, accurate & "real"--it isn't derived from the GPS.

@4zjs @enneff @tastapod if that chunk of code need tweaking I don't want to maintain the interface that fits all variations

@4zjs @enneff @tastapod functional programmers I know abstract more than the avg imperative programmer I am. expr compose better than stmt?
@4zjs @enneff @tastapod then you end up maintaining a bunch of 1liners functions, that works well in Haskell not so well in C or Go.
@4zjs @enneff @tastapod if that chunk of code need tweaking I don't want to maintain the interface that fits all variations
@enneff @4zjs @tastapod ah I used the ginger cake pattern before, we used to call it: "relocatable chunk of code"

@zef @creationix then it looks like a crosbug
@creationix @zef if you package it as a Chrome app, you can start it in windowed mode and Aura should pass through all keystrokes.

@4zjs @enneff @tastapod functional programmers I know abstract more than the avg imperative programmer I am. expr compose better than stmt?
@4zjs @enneff @tastapod then you end up maintaining a bunch of 1liners functions, that works well in Haskell not so well in C or Go.
@4zjs @enneff @tastapod if that chunk of code need tweaking I don't want to maintain the interface that fits all variations

@zef @creationix then it looks like a crosbug
@creationix @zef if you package it as a Chrome app, you can start it in windowed mode and Aura should pass through all keystrokes.

@tpolecat but I already do, by extending Traversable.

@tpolecat Good point. So its not really monadic as its flatMap will return a different container type.

@tpolecat but I already do, by extending Traversable.

@tpolecat Good point. So its not really monadic as its flatMap will return a different container type.

@tpolecat but I already do, by extending Traversable.
@runT1ME @tpolecat mutating and monads don't mix well. But, this code sample is immutable. Still, thx for your answer, good to know.
. @runT1ME Hmm that's a bit hard to figure out. Do _you_ think it is monadic? :)

@tedneward @bsletten @secos even FP doesn't make AOP's ideas irrelevant (see my Scala Days 11 presentation http://t.co/YTXs5qcjMH)
@tedneward @bsletten @secos keep coming back in various forms
@tedneward @bsletten @secos I believe the ideas in AOP are right and the concept of "pointcut" (imo, the core innovation)...
@tedneward @bsletten @secos were so common, it didn't make sense to have user write those aspects themselves
@tedneward @bsletten @secos True that the main AOP usages in Spring weren't exposed to users because those crosscutting concerns...

@tedneward @bsletten @secos even FP doesn't make AOP's ideas irrelevant (see my Scala Days 11 presentation http://t.co/YTXs5qcjMH)
@tedneward @bsletten @secos keep coming back in various forms
@tedneward @bsletten @secos I believe the ideas in AOP are right and the concept of "pointcut" (imo, the core innovation)...
@tedneward @bsletten @secos were so common, it didn't make sense to have user write those aspects themselves
@tedneward @bsletten @secos True that the main AOP usages in Spring weren't exposed to users because those crosscutting concerns...
@tedneward @bsletten @secos Gregor expected AspectJ to be a "15% solution" so pure AOP language was never expected http://t.co/SzLfGI4lzv

@tedneward @bsletten @secos even FP doesn't make AOP's ideas irrelevant (see my Scala Days 11 presentation http://t.co/YTXs5qcjMH)

@tedneward @bsletten @secos I believe the ideas in AOP are right and the concept of "pointcut" (imo, the core innovation)...
@tedneward @bsletten @secos were so common, it didn't make sense to have user write those aspects themselves
@tedneward @bsletten @secos True that the main AOP usages in Spring weren't exposed to users because those crosscutting concerns...

Hey @markhibberd, just playing with argonaut, implicits for {De,En}codeJson[String] exist but not CodecJson. Am I missing something?
Implicit typeclass extending AbstractFunctionN causes auto application/boxing. Extremely unsafe. I'm getting sick of #Scala's "magic".

@bitemyapp Hey thanks man, I'll remember that :) My brain already has a massive backlog though, 'No Vacancy' written on my forehead. (1/2)
@bitemyapp ... not to mention that the abstraction I'm after is usually already implemented in scalaz, which is awesome.
@bitemyapp Discovering math/CS/CT constructs. So like "f a b -> f a' b' -> f (a,a') (b,b')" → ooo what are arrows? → read laws, papers, etc.

Hey @markhibberd, just playing with argonaut, implicits for {De,En}codeJson[String] exist but not CodecJson. Am I missing something?

@bitemyapp ... not to mention that the abstraction I'm after is usually already implemented in scalaz, which is awesome.

@jsuereth @sonatype_ops Ok, thanks a lot! I think I saw this once before, where it miraculously worked later. Will let u know what I found.
@jsuereth I set it with credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager", "http://t.co/7xvzm8Fn0G", "user", "pass")
@jsuereth Think so, I used the same creds with which I logged to http://t.co/7xvzm8Fn0G just now. For wrong creds, it gives me: Unauthorized
@jsuereth But I'm publishing, not resolving in this case, no? My configuration is as specified here: http://t.co/emuKWlpFb3

@jsuereth in this case, it's scala-blitz_2.11-1.2, https://t.co/2jYVU73fbb

@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Reactive manifesto, oth, tries to mix in concepts like fault-tolerance and scalability - personally, I think...
@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Originally RP is about dataflow and propagation of change, FRP just took it to a higher level.
@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Note that reactive streams have ideas similar to Rx, and they are a part of the reactive manifesto.

@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Reactive manifesto, oth, tries to mix in concepts like fault-tolerance and scalability - personally, I think...
@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Originally RP is about dataflow and propagation of change, FRP just took it to a higher level.
@ppurang @flangy @timperrett Note that reactive streams have ideas similar to Rx, and they are a part of the reactive manifesto.

@bitemyapp @patbrisbin basic point about types good & fixable if reworded, st like “any item in the result must have appeared in the input”?
@patbrisbin how about a function that returns the input list if its length is prime, otherwise returns the empty list? is that the “same”?
@patbrisbin you can call those trivial variations if you want, but then you can't make the “precisely 4” claim. what def. of “precisely”?
@patbrisbin you can call those variations on the “same” behavior if you want, but only by a subjective definition of “same”
@patbrisbin repeat the input list 0 times, repeat it 1 time, repeat it 2 times, repeat it 3 times, ... these are different functions
@patbrisbin see the point you want to make, but what you actually wrote is, at best, misleading. I'd call it just plain false
@patbrisbin items in result, if any, must appear in input. behavior is unconstrained otherwise. I'd call that infinite possibilities.

@bitemyapp @patbrisbin basic point about types good & fixable if reworded, st like “any item in the result must have appeared in the input”?
@patbrisbin how about a function that returns the input list if its length is prime, otherwise returns the empty list? is that the “same”?
@patbrisbin you can call those trivial variations if you want, but then you can't make the “precisely 4” claim. what def. of “precisely”?
@patbrisbin you can call those variations on the “same” behavior if you want, but only by a subjective definition of “same”
@patbrisbin repeat the input list 0 times, repeat it 1 time, repeat it 2 times, repeat it 3 times, ... these are different functions
@patbrisbin see the point you want to make, but what you actually wrote is, at best, misleading. I'd call it just plain false
@patbrisbin items in result, if any, must appear in input. behavior is unconstrained otherwise. I'd call that infinite possibilities.

@bitemyapp @patbrisbin basic point about types good & fixable if reworded, st like “any item in the result must have appeared in the input”?
@patbrisbin how about a function that returns the input list if its length is prime, otherwise returns the empty list? is that the “same”?
@patbrisbin you can call those trivial variations if you want, but then you can't make the “precisely 4” claim. what def. of “precisely”?
@patbrisbin you can call those variations on the “same” behavior if you want, but only by a subjective definition of “same”
@patbrisbin repeat the input list 0 times, repeat it 1 time, repeat it 2 times, repeat it 3 times, ... these are different functions
@patbrisbin see the point you want to make, but what you actually wrote is, at best, misleading. I'd call it just plain false
@patbrisbin items in result, if any, must appear in input. behavior is unconstrained otherwise. I'd call that infinite possibilities.

Either way, I totally forgot to trash my hotel room or have a tantrum when the projector resolution was too small. Sorry.

@heades I'm giving a talk at LFMTP on Thursday, though I need to match a plane more or less straight after. Just pottering about today.
@heades Oh, I take it you're in Vienna too then!
@scratchwork No, as long as it adds value of course - we have lots of system tests after all. Best discuss on mailing list.
@pdxfunc @pdxleif Sounds entertaining. On my way. Might be a bit late ;).
@Simon_JF I was thinking of using Comic Sans more just to troll people, but I realised I'm not SPJ so I'd never get away with it.
Okay, I've just had my first chance to catch up with the cricket today. Is the BBC winding me up?

@TransitionUStA Question 6 doesn't have "None" as an option! This seems pretty important... it did let me leave it blank though.
@Cynede You can do pattern matching in lambdas... or do you mean something else?
@Cynede I expect we can make case cleverer
@bitemyapp @ejenk I've heard loads from lots of people - many are fair, but many are myths that need busting...
@bitemyapp @ejenk (It is much harder to tell what the complications are from the inside, after all)
@bitemyapp @ejenk Will keep working on it until it is more obviously true :). Meanwhile, please let us know where the complications are!
@bitemyapp @ejenk I'd say the type system *is* simpler, but we need to work harder to explain that, and to get the high level language right
@bitemyapp @ejenk Depends how you're measuring ;)

@Lenary @andy_m_wood I've been describing Idris as a language for hipsters who find Scala too mainstream. Think I'll get away with it? ;)
@andy_m_wood By Greenspun's Tenth Rule, that is almost certainly true...

@propensive I couldn’t hear them anyway...
@propensive Martin is quite muffled now, maybe facing the panel would work better...
@propensive it might work...
@propensive only when Martin or Jonathan talk...
Maybe next time it goes silent I’ll say something unlikely like “We should all use PHP instead” #scala2014

It turns out it is possible to give a conference talk over Skype. Whether anyone actually heard what I was saying, I have no idea ;).
@folone That’s remarkably legible... I was imagining some kind of blurred mess...
@KLM that is correct
@KLM You haven’t contacted me about this yet. Please can you do so urgently - I am *not* taking the flight you mistakenly rebooked me on.
@dblhelix I suppose it depends who drives the klm feed. Apparently a Twitter id is sufficient identification too...!
@dblhelix I'm not blaming the weather! Just the bizarre way I got booked onto the wrong flight without asking... should have made it fine.
.@d_christiansen @heathercmiller @grammarware I am totally up for this if the organisers are. I’m not letting @KLM defeat me!
@KLM > It also worries me that there was no confirmation of my identity other than my twitter handle.
@KLM > There would have been no problem if I hadn’t sent the enquiry!
@KLM > As a result, I will not be able to give a keynote at a conference, or use my prepaid non-refundable hotel
@KLM > The airport staff had *already* rebooked me but via twitter I was rebooked without anyone confirmed it was what I wanted.
@KLM Yes, and it gets me there too late for the conference I am speaking at. There is no point in me going now. >
@IPv2 I think I might give up travelling with him too
@kerastion I'll investigate when I get back. It is worth a try!
I wonder if it's possible to do a live screencast these days. If I'm failing to turn up in person... any ideas? /cc @heathercmiller
@KLM please can you ring me about this asap? I can't get through on reservation line. You made a mistake and I need to cancel the booking.
@milessabin I was looking forward to it too... now I’ll be “That guy who didn’t turn up for his keynote” which is somewhat embarrassing.
That's it, time is up, I can't make it until after the end of the #Scala workshop. Sorry all. Was looking forward to it too :(.
Turns out @KLM did indeed re book me without asking. Half an hour to fix it to get me back on the right plane and rescue my future custom.
Well this is interesting. Airport staff booked me on one flight, @KLM Twitter another (useless) flight. I wonder which it will be...
@KLM Thanks, but I just sorted something out at NCL to rebook for the 2100 at AMS. Is that still valid? Ideally need to get there tonight!
@KLM Thanks, but I just sorted something out at NCL to get the 2100 from AMS. Which booking is now valid? Need to be there tongiht if poss.
@propensive Newcastle, via Schiphol. Long queue for one agent at the moment... Still hope to get on a later flight tonight!
@pedrofurla @propensive @milessabin might be a blank tape at this rate if so...
I suppose I should finish off my talk, on the off chance I arrive in time to give it. I’m sure you know never to travel with me by now ;).
@kingstrato That is, sadly, my assumption...
@kingstrato And having to get to Birmingham. There is a lot of Britain north of Manchester.
@kingstrato Not for me it won’t - still got to get there. So many people fly to London just to fly out. No wonder it’s so busy!
@LakshithadSilva I'm beginning to suspect that. Although my theory is that they want to delay having to give out food vouchers.
@KLM I'm on kl0960 then connecting to kl1117. Is there a chance I'll still make it today?
I see the inbound flight is delayed by 3 hours. The information desk hasn't got that information yet. Maybe they don't have internet.
This wouldn't be a problem if you could actually fly anywhere from the northern half of Britain... #grumpynortherner
@avsm my flight is still listed on time but I find that hard to believe...
Oh good. Long delays at Schiphol. This is going to make my efforts to get to the #scala workshop more interesting than I'd like.
